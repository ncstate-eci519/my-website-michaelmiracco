            EdTech Tools
        </h1>
            <p>
                While spending so much time in the College of Education, I have discovered a number of educational technology tools that work well within the classroom.
                Among some of the many that I find incredible are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Padlet</li>
                    <li>Socrative</li>
                    <li>Peardeck</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Padlet</strong> does incredibly well at allowing students to speak amongst each other, without making themselves the center of aatention.
                The tool also allows students to interact on a simple, yet interesting forum amongst their peers and professionals that is both engaging and worthwhile.
                <strong>Socrative</strong> gives both students and educators oppurtunities to participate in online examination of subject matter on an individual and social level.
                Students have fun taking interactive tests about what has been taught, and educators can observe student answers and provide feedback, in real time.
                <strong>Peardeck</strong> combines presentation, inquiry-based learning, and assessment all in one tool, covering every base an educator could ask for to provide their students with successful learning.
                 It's features support student engagement in ways that focus on the importances of classroom interaction.
