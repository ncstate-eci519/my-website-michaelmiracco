            Since the beginning, skateboarders have carried the stimga that they are all losers, good-for-nothing lowlifes, and beings who will never make anything of themselves.
            As for myself, I live to break these stereotypes and be an example of how skateboarding can improve one's life in every aspect.
            While I prepare to graduate with my Bachelor's from here at NC State, I think back on all of the times skateboarding has made my experience here better, and has helped shape me into the learner I am today.
            Earlier, we discussed some of my favorite modes of educational technology, and while you cannot impliment skating into the classroom directly, I believe that the experience and lifestyle of skateboarding makes people better learners.

            As skateboarding continues to become more popular in today's culture, skaters are given an oppurtunity to change the perception of the lifestyle from a public annoyance to that of free-thinkers looking to have fun and master a skill.
            Skaters work on a trick until they get it right.
            They try 10000 times to roll away from a trick one time.
            They are learning problem-solving and self-starting, creating their own obstacles for tricks more times than not.
            Zoe Corwin, a college access researcher at the University of Southern California says in an article with K-12 Dive, "(skaters have) an ease with which they communicate across cultural groups.
            Race doesn't matter. If I'm a college admissions person, those are the kinds of kids that I want."
            Skateboarding also allows it's people to explore their passions, which often expands past skateboarding itself.
            Personally, skateboarding has allowed me to discover my passion for education and technology throughout my yeers at university, and although the two worlds of the sport and work field may not directly compare, I believe that without my passion for riding my board, I would not have found my love for my career choice.
